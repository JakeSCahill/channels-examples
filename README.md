# About

This repository contains sample code for you to get started with the Channels application in IOTA Streams.

You can find documentation for these examples on the [IOTA documentation portal](https://docs.iota.org/docs/channels/introduction/get-started.md).

## Getting started

To get started you need [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed on your device.

1. Clone this repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JakeSCahill/channels-examples
    cd channels-examples
    ```

2. Open the `src/main.rs` file and change the author's secret to something secure

    ```rust
    // REPLACE THE SECRET WITH YOUR OWN
    let mut author = Author::new("MYAUTHORSECRET", 3, true);
    ```

3. Publish the channel

    ```bash
    cargo run --release --bin my_channel_app
    ```

    It may take a minute or two to download and compile the dependencies.

    In the console, you should see that the message was sent.

    ```bash
    Channel address: ESSPLXFXCODZEDRDZ9MEVSQAEDB9ENELCZD9YEWJZTMWFEPSONIMPATCBTKBOSEX9KCESXEWD9MIZSAPT
    `Announce` message identifier: RACLH9SDQZEYXOLWFG9WOLVDQHT
    Channel published
    ```

4. Copy the message identifier to the clipboard

5. Open the `src/main.rs` file, uncomment the following code, and update the variables with your message identifier and your own public payload:

    ```rust
    // REPLACE WITH YOUR OWN MESSAGE IDENTIFIER
    let announce_message_identifier = "RACLH9SDQZEYXOLWFG9WOLVDQHT";

    let public_payload = "MYPUBLICMESSAGE";
    let private_payload = "";

    match send_signed_message(&mut author, channel_address, (&announce_message_identifier).to_string(), public_payload.to_string(), private_payload.to_string(), &mut client, send_opt){
        Ok(()) => (),
        Err(error) => println!("Failed with error {}", error),
    }
    ```

    **Note:** Keep the private payload empty.

    The `private_payload` argument is encrypted only if you link the `SignedPacket` message to a `Keyload` message.

    In this case, you link the message to an `Announce` message, so the `private_payload` argument would not be encrypted anyway.

6. Comment out the following code so that you don't publish another instance of the channel

    ```rust
    /*
    // Send the `Announce` message
    match start_a_new_channel(&mut author, &mut client, send_opt) {
        Ok(()) => (),
        Err(error) => println!("Failed with error {}", error),
    }
    */
    ```

    **Note:** Authors should publish only one instance of a channel. Otherwise, subscribers will not know which channel to use.

7. Send the signed message

    ```bash
    cargo run --release --bin my_channel_app
    ```

    In the console, you should see that the message was sent.

    ```bash
    `Signed_packet` message identifier: ICOTSLXXTKVXDNWFPG9LOFUQRJS
    Sent signed message
    ```

8. Open the `bin/subscriber.rs` file, change the subscriber's secret to something secure, and update the variables with your own channel address and message identifiers

    ```rust
     // REPLACE THE SECRET WITH YOUR OWN
    let mut subscriber = Subscriber::new("MYSUBSCRIBERSECRET", true);
    ```

9. Read and authenticate the message

    ```bash
    cargo run --release --bin subscriber
    ```

    In the console, you should see that the subscriber was able to receive and authenticate the message.

    ```
    Receiving announcement messages
    Found and authenticated STREAMS9CHANNEL9ANNOUNCE message
    Receiving signed messages
    Found and authenticated messages
    Public message: MYPUBLICMESSAGE, private message: 
    ```
